## ✨ What You Will Learn

- Setting up Python and VS Code
- Creating a virtual environment using `pipenv`
- Installing Django and starting a project
- Understanding Models, Views, Templates (MVT architecture)
- Building and registering forms and models
- Connecting your app with SQLite and MySQL
- Using the Django Admin Panel
- Creating dynamic pages and rendering data using templates

---

## 🔹 Overview

- Django is a powerful Python web framework designed for building dynamic web applications efficiently.
- The framework promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design principles.
- Key concepts covered include setting up the development environment, models, views, and templates.

---

## 📃 Setting Up the Environment

- To start, download the latest version of Python and install VS Code as the code editor.
- Essential packages, including the Python extension and the SQLite Viewer extension, need to be installed for database management.
- Utilize the command line to install `pipenv` for creating and managing virtual environments, which will isolate project dependencies.

---

## 💼 Creating a Django Project

- Create a new Django project using the command `django-admin startproject <project_name>`.
- After project creation, navigate into the project directory and activate the virtual environment with `pipenv shell`.
- Use `python manage.py` for project management tasks, including running the server or creating new applications.

---

## 🔍 Understanding MVT Architecture

- Django follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture, which divides the application into three main components:
  - **Model**: Manages the data structure and database interactions.
  - **View**: Handles the logic and user requests, processing inputs and returning responses.
  - **Template**: Manages the presentation layer, defining how data is presented to users.

## 📊 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Python installed on your system
- VS Code as the code editor

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Python and VS Code

1. Download Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download VS Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install Python extension and SQLite Viewer in VS Code

### Step 2: Setup Virtual Environment

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install django
pipenv shell
```

### Step 3: Create a Django Project

```bash
django-admin startproject firstproject
cd firstproject
python manage.py startapp firstapp
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
firstproject/
├── firstproject/
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
├── firstapp/
    ├── views.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── forms.py
    ├── urls.py
```

---

## 📊 Creating Models and Migrations

- Models are defined as Python classes within the `models.py` file, which represent database tables.
- To create a model, inherit from `models.Model` and define attributes that correspond to database fields.
- Use `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply changes to the database schema.

---

## 📝 Building Views

- Views can be function-based or class-based, with function-based views created by defining a function that processes requests.
- Each view is linked to a URL through the `urls.py` file, enabling user navigation within the application.
- Implement HTTP responses to send data back to the client based on user actions.

---

## 📚 Working with Templates

- Templates are HTML files that define the user interface and display dynamic content.
- Use Django template language features to incorporate data from views, including loops and conditional statements.
- Templates can extend a base HTML file, allowing for consistent layout across different pages.

---

## 💼 Admin Interface and Forms

- Django provides an admin interface for managing application data, which can be customized by registering models in `admin.py`.
- Forms are essential for user input; create forms using Django’s form classes to handle data validation and persistence.
- Use the `POST` method to submit form data, ensuring data is processed and saved to the database.

---

## 📈 Database Management and Additional Features

- Django defaults to SQLite but supports other databases like MySQL, requiring configuration changes in `settings.py`.
- The database is accessed and modified through Django’s ORM, allowing for easy data manipulation without SQL queries.
- Utilize additional Django features such as user authentication, middleware, and URL routing to enhance application functionality.

---

## 🚀 Final Output

- A working Django web app with forms, views, and dynamic pages
- Admin panel integration
- SQLite/MySQL database support
- Menu listing and item details for a restaurant

---

## 🔹 Conclusion

- The crash course provides a solid foundation for building web applications with Django, covering environment setup, project creation, MVT architecture, and key components for development.
- Further exploration of Django’s extensive documentation can deepen understanding and facilitate building more complex applications.
